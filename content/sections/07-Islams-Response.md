> "We were in the hands of our persecutors, when my father, out of the affection he bore me, made new efforts to shake my resolution.<br/>I said to him: ‘Can that vessel, which you see, change its name?’<br/>He said: ‘No.’<br/>I replied: ‘Nor can I call myself any other than I am, that is to say, a Christian.’?" - St. Perpetua, Martyr, 203 AD

There’s a young heroine named Perpetua in Tunisian history. 

She was a Christian convert in 2nd century Carthage – the modern day Tunisia.

_(Insert map of Tunisia & Carthage here)_

Perpetua was a young mother from a wealthy family. She was one of the first to be arrested, along with her Christian servant Felicitas, when an empire-wide verdict came from the Roman Emperor Septimus who had a strong distaste for Christianity which was booming underground in North Africa. 

She refused several chances to renounce her faith. The mere act of offering one pinch of incense to the Roman gods would have spared her life. She would not.

She was martyred at the age of 22 in a stadium with wild beasts and gladiators. Crowds roared for her gruesome slaughter. She was slain with a sword to her death in 203 A.D. 

The resilience of the Christian martyrs sparked a spread of Christianity throughout Carthage. A fiery form of Christianity flourished underground as persecution continued; but when the Roman Empire declared Christianity as the empire’s state religion in 380 A.D., religious freedoms for Christians abounded in Carthage. The churches, coming out of hiding, found comfort in their new freedoms. 

Divisions in Christianity began to form in North Africa. A Christian sect called Donatism emerged as a disapproving response to those Christians who had renounced their faith under persecution. Donatists disagreed with some Early Church doctrines and religious leaders, especially those who had fallen away from the Christian faith during the persecution period. Internal divisions within Christianity began weakening the unity of the Early Church in Carthage. 

Coming out from underground, Christians, who once vigorously fought for their faith to survive, felt little need to protect their faith. Christianity began to be institutionalized, taking on a more rigid form in rites of worship. Over time, Christianity became a culture. The fire of their forefathers was quenched among Christian believers in Carthage. 

During this time, the Early Church first agreed on a common canon of texts to include in the New Testament. This meeting took place in Carthage in the year 397 A.D. The New Testament of the Bible was codified in the land of Carthage, which would later become Tunisia.

## The Islamic conquest and extinction of the Church

Muslim Arabs invaded Carthage in the late 7th century. 

The church of Carthage, already dwindling in their faith in the centuries of religious freedoms and internal divisions, were offered three options: to pay high taxes as Christians, to convert to Islam, or exile. Historically, when Islam dominated over nations, the non-Muslims had a choice to pay taxes for protection (called _Jizyah_) or to leave the country of Islam. 

The Islamic conquest of North Africa was powerful and it was politically, militarily, economically and culturally attractive. 

Many chose to convert to Islam; eventually, the church in Tunisia vanished. 

That is, until today. 

Modern-day Christianity in Tunisia is a new phenomenon. 

It’s a reflection of its historical counterpart; the church remains largely underground and hidden. But it is flourishing.  

The exact date of its conception in Tunisia is difficult to pinpoint. But religious leaders in Tunisia estimate that Christianity began rousing in Tunisia roughly 40 years ago. 

“I was a Christian alone, in my house,” said Ibrahim Bahri, 62. Many Tunisian Christians say Ibrahim is the longest-believing Christian they know. He converted to Christianity 20 years ago through a television program he watched of Zakaria Botros, a famous Egyptian Coptic Priest. For several years, he was the only Christian he knew. “I always read the Bible alone, I prayed alone.” 

Later, his wife and children changed their faith. 

Today he’s a part of an aboveground church community in Tunis. He’s able to study theology and the Bible with others like him. 

With two decades of practice ahead of the younger Christian generation, his church brothers and sisters call him their “spiritual dad” and he calls them his sons and daughters.

But it is recently in the past five years when the Tunisian church is seeing patterns of conversions of young, Tunisian Muslims leaving Islam for Christianity. 

## An imam’s response: Imam Bilel Arfaoui [video](ImamBilelHeader.MP4)

Imam Bilel Arfaoui, 30, is the religious leader of Mosque Hay Raja in Tebourba, a small-town couched in olive groves on the outskirts of the capital. 

It was in Tebourba, then _Thuburbo Minus_, where the Christian martyr Perpetua was arrested in the 2nd century. 

Today, there is no sign of Christianity left in this town, except for the public library in the town’s center that was previously the Church of Tebourba (or sometimes referred to as the Church of St. Perpetua.)  

[image](publiclibrarytebourba.jpg " ")

With his reserved, gentle voice, the imam recited the Qur’an by heart: _“And you will find the nearest of them in affection to the believers (Muslims) those who say, ‘We are Christians.’”_ (Surat al-Maida 82)

Imam Arfaoui said he teaches his congregation to respect other religions, especially Christians who hold the faith closest to Islam. “We have to respect them like they are Muslim.” 

But in terms of the beliefs in Christianity, he said that Christians fabricated that Isa (Jesus in the Qur’an) is the Son of God, which is a blasphemous claim in Islam.  

“For us, this is a big lie because God doesn’t have sons,” he said. 

When asked if he’s ever met a Tunisian who became a Christian, he answered:

“No. No. That’s impossible.” 

[video](ImamBilel_VID.MP4 " ")

Turning to Christianity can be seen as going backwards, he said, since Muslims believe Islam advanced Christianity and that it is the most complete version of the religion of the Abrahamic God. 

Imam Arfaoui said that Muslims who convert to Christianity have been bribed or scammed for financial gains.  

Among the young generation, he said, many leave Islam hoping to emigrate to the western world. 

“Meaning that it’s a way of becoming artificial Christians,” he said. 

The secular society that was promulgated by the previous Bourguiba and Ben Ali regimes led to a Tunisia that has little to no understanding of the rules and fundamentals of Islam, he said. Until the revolution in 2011, Islamic speeches and worship were restricted to the mosques and prayers to the homes. As a result, many Tunisian homes do not fully practice the rules of Islam, and are just Muslim only in name, he said. 

In many cases, converts don’t know much about Islam and haven’t done the research necessary to pursue Islam, according to the imam.

“People who left Islam are people whose beliefs are not strong,” he said. “If he’s strong (in Islam), he would never change.” 

“So this new generation in these homes grow without knowing anything about Islam.” 

“They don’t know their own religion.” 


> "For someone who just looks at the church, he will only notice the music, instruments, the singing, the violin, the pianos. It’s romantic." - Imam Arfaoui

## Romantic religion

Instead, this generation is now turning to what he calls the “romantic religion.” 

It’s a religion that preaches love and patience and its rites involve singing and dancing amidst the melodies of strings and pianos, said the imam. 

Christianity markets this romantic religion, he said. “So the young people of hip hop and songs, they start getting very attracted and find refuge in this religion.” 

“They see Christianity as a romantic religion and not as effort-consuming as Islam,” said Imam Arfaoui.  

Converts like Manel Marai said they were drawn by the Christian message of peace and love is preached. “It was goodness and love, and especially how God represented love – that was the thing that spoke to me the most,” she said. 

Also, finding refuge in a God that is also a father figure is another difference between the two religions that Tunisian converts find attractive about Christianity. 

“Growing up without a father and learning that I can have a father, it really touched me,” said Manel. In Islam, it is blasphemous to refer to God as father, as it degrades the sanctity of God to associate him directly with humans; meanwhile in Christianity, Jesus is the Son of God who was sacrificed for humans and his followers are “adopted” into God’s family. 

These are romantic notions of Christianity that may attract those who are seeking to leave Islam. 


## Persecution

There is no problem with Christians who were born Christian, said the imam. Tunisia is tolerant with foreigners; it heavily depends on its tourism industry, which attracts tourists from mainly Europe with Judeo-Christian backgrounds. 

The problem is when Tunisian Muslims, “who knew the reality of Islam,” leaves it. “That’s why it’s difficult for some people to accept them.” 

It is “out of love,” he said, that the society puts pressure on the converts. “Because we believe in Islam that you have to be a Muslim to go to heaven. People want him (the convert) to come back to Islam.” 

However, not everyone in Tunisian society will actively engage in the persecution of Christian Tunisians. There are degrees in discrimination that take place, from direct, physical discrimination to indirect, unspoken psychological discrimination. Some Muslims are more likely to discriminate, for instance, groups who practice more extreme versions of Islam like _Ansar al-Shariah_ in Tunisia. 

However, there is a general, social stigma that exists in Tunisia, which may or may not be used by individuals in the majority to discriminate against the Christian religious minority. 

Imam Arfaoui said that he considers the Tunisian Christian converts as “khayyibeen,” (literally translated as “bad”) giving the example of “bad boys who drink and commit adultery.” These young men are also leaving the traditions and religion of their families. 

“It’s the same case,” he said. “Because he knew the truth, but went to the way of Satan.”

But in the end, “he has the right to choose what he wants.” 


## An imam’s response: Imam Afif Sbabti [video](ImamAfif_Header.MP4 " ")

The basis of Christianity is illogical, said Imam Afif Sbabti. 

But “we have to respect and treat them like people who are close to us,” he said.

Imam Sbabti, 58, is the Vice President of Zitouna University, one of the oldest teaching institutions in Tunisia for Islamic studies. He’s a theology professor, teaching the _Hadith_, collections of sayings of the Prophet Muhammad. On Fridays, his melodious voice echoes throughout the streets in the capital when he preaches at his mosque. Al-Fatah Mosque, one of the most recognized mosques downtown, gets so crowded every Friday that it overflows in to the streets.

The imam has a lavish office with double doors in the Ministry of Religious Affairs government building. His charm and cheerful smile radiates brighter than his _horkah_ (white robe and cap), especially as he receives guests into his royal-red office. Official documents are required by law to receive permission to interview imams in Tunisia; when requesting permission, the ministry put Imam Sbabti’s name forward and insisted he be interviewed. 


## The money explanation

In the two decades under the Ben Ali regime, Tunisia went through a period where imams were not allowed to preach on TV or freely in public. People slunk into feelings of emptiness, said the imam. He explained that people were empty spiritually and financially: 

“Christians had a lot of money. I know some people who were converted because these people (Christians) helped them and gave them money. So bit by bit, they changed their faith and became Christian.”

This perception in Tunisia is quite common among the people. People in the streets, when asked why they believe a Tunisian Muslim would convert to Christianity offers this very explanation without hesitation. 

This allegation is not completely without foundation. In history, the Catholic church has funded projects to build hospitals and schools in Tunisia, as well as participating in “good works” in helping the poor. Recently, there have been cases when foreign churches or missionaries have provided money to local Christian believers, according to members of the Tunisian Christian community. “They were too poor with bad housing and couldn’t pay for medicine,” said Dali Khlifi, a Tunisian Christian, who knows of just one man who received financial support. But these are very rare cases, with most Tunisian Christians describing a spiritual reason for their departure from Islam into Christianity, according to members of the Tunisian church.  

But other misunderstandings about Christianity are rampant in Muslim societies like Tunisia. Many Muslims associate Christianity with Hollywood and the United States (with whom many Muslims are unimpressed). To them, all Christians get drunk, commit adultery, and have a green light to sin; others think that Christianity is akin to Judaism (which can be problematic since most of the Arab world has strong feelings about the Israel-Palestine question.) 

Some call Christians atheists. “Actually, I have some people who respect atheists more than Christians,” said Dali.

For Tunisian Christians living under such presumptions, these attitudes can be enough to keep them hidden or censor their identities and words. For other Christians, this misunderstanding is a source of deep, bottled up hurt.

There is no persecution in Tunisia, according to the Imam. “It has never existed in the past and it won’t exist in the future,” he said matter-of-factly. 

But after hearing some of the stories of the Tunisian Christians who received physical persecution, the imam furrowed his brows, opened his mouth, then closed it. 

“I’ve never heard of this before. Not on TV, not in the paper. I’ve never heard of these. These stories exist?”

He shook his head, eyes narrowing in concern. “It’s incomprehensible.”

Then he asked again if these stories happened in Tunisia. He shook his head and muttered under his breath, “C’est impossible.” _That’s impossible._ 

After a prolonged pause he heaved a deep sigh.

“Anyways, it’s a minority. That’s why we don’t hear these stories.”

He said he believes that the Christians were wronged. To the story about Maya Ibrahim, the Tunisian Christian who was chained and beaten by her father and brother, the tone of his voice raised slightly. 

“They should have tried to understand why she changed her faith. What was it about Islam that she didn’t accept? With a bit of discussion, I believe we could have convinced her to return to Islam.”


## Shock factor 

But he offered the Muslim perspective for when they find out one of their kin converted to Christianity. 

“The Muslim point of view is this: how can one change their faith? If that faith (Christianity) were logical, then maybe it would be accepted. But how do you change your faith to one that is illogical? It’s shocking.” 

Apostasy is defined as abandonment of a religious faith or a previous loyalty. In Islam, it is the act of denying and leaving Islam for another or no religion. Apostasy is a concept that emerged after the death of the Prophet Muhammad as a reaction to Arabs wishing to secede from the Muslim community that the prophet created, according to Karim Karim, a Carleton University professor with a background in Islamic studies. There were debates among theologians on whether this was an act of political or religious separation. Over time, apostasy was predominantly understood as an act of leaving the religion in Islam. It is still widely debated today. 

There are various interpretations of apostasy in Islam. For more fundamentalist Islamic groups or societies like Morocco, Iran or Saudi Arabia, apostasy is completely prohibited and punishable by death. On the other end of the spectrum, there are Islamic scholars like Abdullahi Ahmed An-Naim who push for universal solidarity and prohibiting the punishment for apostasy in dominant Islamic discourses.  

Imam Sbabti said that Tunisian society is tolerant, so the people will eventually accept the circumstances of the Tunisians who convert out of Islam into Christianity. 

“Maybe we’re a little shocked in the beginning and we don’t accept it. How can a Muslim become a Christian? People are shocked, but after some time they will accept it.”


> “Was he not a human being and did he not have a soul?" - Prophet Muhammad, Book 11, Hadith 103


## Must protect the minorities

The prophet was gentle with non-Muslims, said the Imam quoting stories from the _Hadith._

“The life of each person is significant,” he said. “I believe that even though they’re a minority, they’re still people who have been mistreated.”

He said that in Islam, non-Muslims must be respected and protected. 

“I am with the minority and I must protect the minority.” 

Ultimately, they are free to choose their own faith, he said.

“Be whatever you are. Whoever you want to be,” said the Imam. “The important thing is that you live with us and respect the laws and principles of the society.”
