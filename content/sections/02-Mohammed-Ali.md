He stood behind his wooden stand layered with cell phones. 

Mirages radiated from the broken cement floor on _Sharaa Bortabluet_. The street of cell phones, they called it, where men sell phones left and right. It was under construction this day and chipped cement and rocks scattered across it. 

The phone vendor wiped the sweat off his shining forehead with his sleeve. August is the hottest month of the summer, when the scorching heat is angriest. And it didn’t help that Gabes was right at the Southern fold of Tunisia, just two hours from the Sahara desert.

Because of Ramadan, the month of fasting in Islam, many of the other men left for refuge in their shaded homes, leaving empty wooden stands behind. But it’s been years since he fasted with them.  

After the revolution this past January 2011, his security company went bankrupt and he went from CEO to penniless. Two months later in March, he became a follower of Jesus of the Bible. His family found out in June and that was the last he saw of them. He had built up the family home from scratch on his father’s land– investing most of the money he made from his security company. After his family kicked him out and refused to give back the money he’d invested in the house, he was scrambling. So he began selling phones on the streets of Gabes. 

From afar, he saw a group of young boys between the ages of 18 and 21. They were advancing towards him. He squinted at one face. 

_Ansar al-Shariah_, he recognized – a right-wing Islamist extremist group, closely tied to Al-Qaeda ideology. 

Then everything happened so fast. 

Hands, fists, feet, punches from every direction. 

Pain surged all over his body. 

He fought back. But there were too many of them. 

They grabbed on to little stones, but large enough to slash his forehead. With each throw, he felt his flesh being torn. 

_God will protect me_.  

_But are they going to do this again?_ 

Chaos. Stones. Blood. 

_God is here._ 

_But I’m being attacked by little boys._

One boy picked up a large block, he watched from the corner of his eye. It was around 20 kg. 

_The ground._

Thump.

_My pride._

Confusion.

_Heat._

Then black.

“I woke up in a hospital,” said Mohamed Ali Horchani, 29, sitting in the corner area of a shadowy, smoke-filled café. “The doctors didn’t believe what happened and that I was still alive.” 

The skull and muscles around his head were unaffected. There were just gashes on his skin. This was divine intervention, according to Mohamed Ali. He decided to become Christian in March 2011, and he was stoned unconscious just months later.

That was the first of many physical attacks he would receive as a Tunisian Christian.

Mohamed Ali eventually made his way up to Tunis. From jobs at cafés to mall security, he was let go just after a week and at the most, a couple of months. Four months was his longest time with one workplace. Once his bosses found out that he was Christian, he was immediately fired. In the past five years, he spent over 27 months out on the streets, said Mohamed Ali. 

“It was hard when night comes and I found myself alone,” he said. “I didn’t know where to sleep, what to eat, so I would rummage the garbage for food.” 

It was during some cold, wet nights in the backstreets of Tunis when police searched him. Upon finding his backpack filled with Christian books, some policemen would harass him, he said. Since under Tunisian law, it is not a crime to be Christian, the police would find ways to provoke Mohamed Ali to react in aggression, he said. He said they would verbally abuse him by slandering his father and mother and would physically assault him. Sometimes he reacted, and this eventually led to a couple of Mohamed Ali’s arrests and some weeks in jail.

Mohamed Ali took out a piece of paper from his red backpack and placed it on the glass table. 

July 4, 2015 to July 16, 2015, it said.  

This was his most recent arrest warrant. He said that he spent over two weeks in jail when a policeman provoked him in the streets and lied, saying he had been beat up by Mohamed Ali. After an investigation into the policeman’s claims, the doctor found no marks or signs of violence on the policeman’s body and Mohamed Ali was let go. It was not possible to independently verify his version of events.

“I felt that my value was no different from that of an animal’s,” he said. 

“It’s hard. It’s really hard.”

## From Saudi to Tunisia 

Mohamed Ali was thinking of selling his laptop in August 2015. He barely had enough to pay his bills and was at risk of being homeless again. 

But this laptop was a special gift from a Nigerian pastor in Tunisia who recognized Mohamed Ali’s passion for sharing his faith in public. The pastor offered it so Mohamed Ali could discuss his faith in chat rooms rather than in public coffee shops where he risked being beaten. 

“I don’t play it safe,” he chuckled. “I don’t shut up.” 

He has a deep understanding of Islam and the Qur’an, having grown up in Saudi Arabia where his father wanted him to become a _Sheikh_, a kind of Islamic leader. His father put him under the supervision of _Sheikh_ Abdul-Mohsen al-Obeikan, a high-profile advisor to the Saudi royal family (_Sheikh_ al-Obeikan was dismissed in 2012 for his attacks on relaxing gender segregation). 

“I started loving God,” he said.  But when he was 16, his family moved back to Tunisia and he saw contradictions in the way of living in the two Muslim countries. He began questioning Islam, thus sparking what he calls his search for the truth throughout his teenage years to mid-twenties, he said. 

He began chatting with Wahhabis and Sabians (two sects of Islam), Zoroastrians, Jews and other faith communities through Paltalk, a live online chat room.  

Later, it was through the internet that Mohamed Ali came to know Christianity. A friend from Egypt had told him about Christianity over Facebook in 2009.  Two years later, after nearly a decade of research, he decided to become a Christian after what he described as a spiritual encounter in his home, when he said he felt the presence of the Christian God. Today, when he’s not working he spends hours on Paltalk discussing religions. 

“I need the internet,” he said. “I want to learn more and more. I need to communicate with pastors and people inquiring about Christianity.” 

Mohamed Ali is a hoarder of knowledge. He reads, researches and discusses. 

But “there is no other solution,” said Mohamed Ali. He carefully folded his black Dell laptop, ran his hand over it as if to pet it and tucked it away in his book-filled bag.

As of summer 2015, Mohamed Ali worked 12 hours a day, six days a week as a security guard at a college in Tunis. His identity as a Christian was still hidden at his workplace, “for now,” he said. But he said he’s searching for a job constantly, in case he gets fired after being exposed. 

Like him, there are other Tunisian Christians who find it difficult to get and keep a job because of the social stigma against Tunisian Christians in the workplace. 

At the same time, there are many non-Christians living in Tunisia who also struggle with finding employment, with the high unemployment rate at 15.4 per cent as of January 2016. This is more than double of Canada’s 7.3 per cent as of February 2016, according to Statistics Canada. Unemployment among Tunisian youth is a plague that is pushing many to join political and religious groups. 

But in the democratically transitioning Tunisia today, it is doubtful that regulations for workplace discrimination against religious minorities are actively administered or even exist, according to Angela Short, Tunisia’s Senior Program Officer for the National Democratic Institute (NDI), a nonpartisan NGO based in Washington that supports democratic processes around the world. “The principle may exist formally, but that would probably be about it,” she said. 

Discrimination against religious minorities is not an issue that too many people pay attention to in Tunisia, said Short. Instead, discussions around gender discrimination, accessibility for people with disabilities, and youth demographics are issues that are given more attention to by elected officials and political parties that the NDI works with in Tunisia, said Short. 

“So within a society that is homogenous in terms of religion, the issue of religious minorities is not something that really comes up,” said Short.

Mohamed Ali took out his latest bank receipt from his pocket. The total on the bottom right corner said 356.594 DT (Tunisian Dinars). That’s a $179.61 USD salary per month.  

His rent was 280 DT per month, including rent he paid for his roommate, another Christian brother he said he saved from the streets. That left him $37.34 USD per month to spend on food, transportation and bills. 

“Hetheka Tunis,” Mohamed Ali shrugged. _This is Tunisia._
