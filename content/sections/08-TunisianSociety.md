Many countries in this region of the world have a deep-rooted religious history where regimes and dictators used religion as a tool of legitimacy. People in many of these North African and Middle Eastern countries often "hire themselves to protect God and to judge other people whether they’re religious or not," said Samy Gerges, Senior Program Officer and a specialist in religious freedoms at Freedom House. This is why religious minorities in these societies find it difficult to come out of hiding, especially if the government doesn't guarantee the exercise of their rights.

But Tunisia is an anomaly. Since its independence in 1956, it had two presidents that advocated a more tolerant, secular country. Despite this, many people in Tunisian society still judge others based on Islam and feel the need to protect and defend Islam as their primary religion. 

## The constitution 

After the toppling of Ben Ali’s 23-year, secular regime in 2011, the moderate Islamist party En-Nahda was elected by a distraught but hopeful Tunisian population to bring a smooth transition into democracy and freedoms. 

However, the interim En-Nahda government, inspired by the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, began to advocate a more Muslim Tunisia alongside its democratic transition. In reaction to the strict rules of the Ben Ali regime preventing Muslims from practicing their faith freely in public, religious freedoms were introduced in the revised 2014 constitution. The revised constitution of 2014 reflects this movement towards a more freely Islamic Tunisia in Article 6: 

<div class="align-center italics">“The state is the guardian of religion. It guarantees freedom of conscience and belief, the free exercise of religious practices and the neutrality of mosques and places of worship from all partisan instrumentalisation.</div>
<br/>
<div class="align-center italics">The state undertakes to disseminate the values of moderation and tolerance and the protection of the sacred, and the prohibition of all violations thereof. It undertakes equally to prohibit and fight against calls for Takfir and the incitement of violence and hatred.”</div>

The attempt to free the practice of Islam succeeded; an array of headscarves and full-body coverings for both men and women filled the streets of Tunisia. Previously jailed religious extremists were freed and once-exiled salafis (fundamental Islamists) flooded back to their country.  

But political, social and religious instability ensued after the revolution, and there was a religious shift. Democracy and secularism intermingled with Islam in a political crock-pot. There were divisions; many Tunisians didn’t identify themselves with the extreme forms of Islam that began penetrating Tunisia. Some did, which explains the efflux of Tunisian youth to Syria and Iraq to fight with Daesh (also known as the Islamic State or ISIS, an Islamist extremist group). Some others found deep disdain for Islam, which may be another factor that causes young Tunisians to leave Islam in search for other forms of faith or political activities. This may be another explanation of the growth of young Tunisian Christians emerging in the underground churches in the past five years. 

The 2014 revision to the constitution can be considered a constitutional success for religious minorities who were now constitutionally free to exercise their own faiths. The “prohibition and fight against calls for _Takfir_” (accusations of apostasy; derived from the world “infidel”) can be interpreted as protection for Tunisians who leave Islam. 

However, a Human Rights Watch analysis of the new constitution states that it “contains several weaknesses and ambiguities that can be used to suppress rights.” The Tunisian League of Human Rights criticized Article 6 as “confusing” in [an article](https://www.worldwatchmonitor.org/2014/01/2962576/) by the World Watch Monitor. The usage of vague words like “guarantee religion” and “protection of the sacred” can lead to threatening interpretations of freedoms that can be abused by fundamentalist Islamist groups to push their agendas, said Gerges.  

Phrases like “It guarantees […] the neutrality of mosques and places of worship from all partisan instrumentalisation” can be misleading, according to Gerges. 
Constitutionally, these laws serve the Muslim majority, meanwhile in practice, it is still difficult for religious minorities to establish and build their own places of worship, he said.  

Also, Article 1 of the Tunisian constitution is not amendable. It states: 
“Tunisia is a free, independent, sovereign state; its religion is Islam, its language is Arabic, and its system is republican. This article may not be amended.” 

“Having the religion of the state mentioned in the constitution is ignoring the rights of the minorities,” said Gerges. By one religion stated as official, religious minorities’ rights are compromised, he said. 
Gerges said the constitutional fuzziness could cause Islamic fanaticism to grow. Although Tunisia has comparatively progressive laws on paper, without proper clarification of the constitution by the government, there is a risk of harmful interpretation of articles such as Article 1 in Tunisia’s constitution that states that the official religion of Tunisia is Islam. Certain phrases and statements can be misinterpreted and abused by fundamentalist groups who may use the law to legitimize their undemocratic activities. This is a particular threat for religious minorities in the near future, he said. Today, many nations in the Middle East are concerned about terrorism within their borders; Libya’s growing base for Daesh (ISIS) fighters is a mounting concern for the international community and for Tunisia, which shares a border.
Along with these security concerns, Tunisia is still facing many challenges in its democratic transition. And “minorities are one of the most vulnerable groups that suffer during transition period,” said Gerges. Many people are craving social stability in the politically and religiously fraught Arab world, especially after the Arab Spring that rocked many countries in to further turmoil. Tunisia came out of the Arab Spring lightly scathed compared to the horrific wars that many of the other countries are still fighting to this day. However, Gerges said that social stability and peace would not be established until the governments grant rights to the religious minorities.

The Tunisian government’s response
“Under the law, the majority and minority – they’re the same,” said Zied Hmoudi, Spokesman for Tunisia’s Ministry of Religious Affairs who’s also responsible for the office of minorities. Hmoudi described Tunisia as a “nation with a positive mentality towards minorities” while talking about the small, established Jewish community in the island of Djerba in Tunisia. 
“Tunisians always accept minorities,” said Hmoudi.

But today in 2016, many Tunisian Christians are still facing hardships linked to their religious identities. 

When asked if the government was aware of persecutions of religious minority groups in Tunisia, Hmoudi answered: “Never. Never. No, in Tunisia, never.” 

He said that religious minorities are free to do as they please in Tunisia, “as long as they don’t compromise the well being of the State”. In other words, disturbing Tunisia’s Muslim civil society through evangelizing or public displays of worship. 

Most political regimes “will favour the majority against the minority, because support for the regime comes from the majority,” said Gerges. 

When asked how the government will protect rights of the minorities in the future, Hmoudi said that the laws in place are good enough. The government said that minorities are not a priority because their focus is the majority. 

> "But there is one underlying drawback that is at the core of this issue: it is that this Tunisian Christian minority is almost invisible to the government, to the rest of Tunisia and the world."


## Minority rights and democracy 

But recognition of religious minorities is considerably developed in Tunisia, compared to other countries in North Africa and the Middle East. The 2015 Freedom House reports say that Tunisia has “freedom of religion to an extent largely unprecedented in the Arab world.” Freedom House, along with many governments and institutions in the West, consider Tunisia a model for other countries in the region. 

But this model democratic country currently lacks the full application of minority religious rights, an important element of democracy.

Constitutionally, one article vaguely guarantees the religious rights of the Tunisian Christians. Socially, to be Christian is still, by in large, taboo.

“It’s not enough to reform the laws,” said Gerges. 

Society's behaviour heavily depends on the state’s willingness to put into action these constitutional rights and freedoms. In Tunisia, there is social discrimination of the religious minorities, overtly and in ways hidden from the public eye. Discrimination can be physical – being beaten and stoned – or it could be mental – being unable to freely express ones identity as a form of censorship.

Giving a voice to the marginalized members of society should be universal in a democracy. But the Tunisian government doesn’t recognize the struggles of its religious minorities. And there is a lack of effort from the government to defend minority rights and apply their constitutional laws into society. 

“The government has to acknowledge that religious minorities are suffering because this has to be one of the priorities,” said Gerges.

But there is an underlying issue: it is that this Tunisian Christian minority is almost invisible to the government, to the rest of Tunisia and the world. 

> "There will be no democracy without actually dealing with religious rights" - Samy Gerges, Freedom House

“Discussions about Christians, Jews, even Shia or Sufi Muslims are just not that relevant in the eyes of the elected officials and political parties, unless there are particular constituencies vying for their support, ” said Angela Short, Tunisia’s Senior Program Officer for the National Democratic Institute. “Currently, it’s just not a part of the major debates happening at the political level in Tunisia right now.” 

But “there will be no democracy without actually dealing with religious rights,” said Gerges. “And empowering the majority to understand minority rights.”

Many Tunisian Christians feel that they are lacking rights, whether it's the right to get married to a non-Muslim or the right to freely carry around a Bible or enter a church without fear of reproach.

“Our rights are not complete,” said Ibrahim Bahri, a Tunisian Christian of 20 years. “We want complete rights.”

On the other hand, other Tunisian Christians say that they are given a lot more rights in comparison to other Islamic countries. They say that their rights exist, but the society makes it harder to access. 

“We do have freedom, but it’s like any other place in the world. Freedom is always limited,” said Dali Khlifi, a Christian convert.  “It gets to a point when you feel really, really, like really, really, really alone.” 

But changes in democracy are difficult to enact if the people aren’t challenging the government to do so, said Gerges. 

“If religious minorities, like the discriminated Christians, found a way to be more vocal, then the political class will be forced to respond,” said Short. 

“Democracy is a partnership,” said Gerges.
