It’s January 14, 2011. 

The Tunisian people flooded L’Avenue Habib Bourguiba at the center of Tunis. 

“When the people will to live!” the sound of the people reverberated through the lines of coiffed ficus trees and polished shops. 

The Tunisian people no longer wanted this regime to stand. Freedom was their cry. 

Little did anyone know, there were some among them who would later become divergent. Some already were. But others, they would later hide from their own people. They would later go undetected. 

But today, they weren’t underground. Some were attending to those who were hurt in the protests. Some were dispersed amid the crowd making their voices heard around the world. They were sparking a fire that would soon spread across North Africa and into the Middle East. 

Today, they were hidden among the people, but with the people.

Together they shouted in one voice: “Destiny must surely respond!”

And this cry echoed through deserts of the Arab Spring.
