It was a large, airy room. It was dark.

There were three bodies inside. Two of them were jerking to a rhythm as sweat dripped down the side of their clenched jaws, strained necks, and flexed arms. 

Their loose, street-style clothes were drenched with perspiration. With every twitch and turn, sweat splattered across the black, wooden stage. The floodlight was crimson, a reflection of the hundreds of fold-up seats and the theatrical curtains that draped the stage.

A metre away, swallowed in the thick air of the theatre, the other body crouched low. 

His eyes were the only moving part of his body. They were filled with concentration and admiration.  

_Snap._

He carefully shifted his olive-green sneakers and turned the lens of his Canon digital SLR. 

They were inside Cinéma le Mondial (Universal Movie Theatre)– a theatre tucked away in a side street at the heart of Tunis. It’s a hot spot for many up and coming dancers in Tunisia. This day, the photographer was shooting the national breakdancing champions of Morocco and Algeria – B-boy Wolf and B-boy Amarou were prepping for their next competition. It was a freelance gig he landed through his cousin.  

It was tough landing freelance work these days. It always is, said the photographer. He often found himself scrambling to pay his rent living in the capital for the past seven years. When he ran out of money, he’d have to drag his feet back home to small-town Jendouba where his family lived. He would work in a call center or find other work until he made just enough to come back to the capital for what he loved: He breathed breakdancing. He lived photography. 

His eyes traced every spin and shuffle of the two dancers. They were just an arms reach away. _How can we be so close, yet so distant?_

He was different from them. And it wasn’t his gangly, tall frame compared to their shorter, boyish ones that easily danced through the air. It wasn’t physical. It was internal. Spiritual, even. 

Many people like the photographer are stoned, stabbed, beaten, and arrested in Tunisia. 

But his story was different. For him, the burden is being muzzled. Censored, he calls it. 

The music stopped. The black speakers on the edge of the stage were mute and there was just a low airy hum of emptiness in the dark theatre.

As he packed up his gear, the three began to converse for what it seemed to be the first time. Small talk.

“What are you up to this weekend?” 

The photographer hesitated. It was a strange digression from his bright personality. He’s talkative, goofy and has a sarcastic sense of humour that draws out snickers. But this day, his shoulders tensed up and he held his breath.

“Keneesa”, he answered. _Church,_ in Arabic.

The two b-boys paused and stared. "Shnouwa?" _What?_

The photographer explained. 

Wolf shook his head. "La, la, la." _No, no, no,_ he said in Arabic.

“Mafhemteksh,” said the Algerian. _I don’t get you._

And that was how the conversation ended. It was all too familiar for the photographer: he’s unnatural; he’s mocked; he’s misunderstood. 

He’s a stranger in his own land.

Dali Khlifi, 27, sat at a café bobbing his head to the music. He took an occasional sip of _qahwah_, a viscous, bitter Arabic espresso with Turkish roots that requires an acquired taste. 

Besides being a photographer and a breakdancer, he’s also a Tunisian Christian. He is one of the estimated 22,000 Tunisian Christians living among Tunisia’s 11 million Muslims.  

Dali left Islam more than three years ago. A close friend living in his dormitory had told him about Christianity. This was the first time Dali had heard about Jesus the Son of God, not Jesus the prophet in Islam. 

“I had to think about my roots, my society,” Dali said, recalling the days leading up to his conversion. 

“I felt like I was cheating on them (his society),” Dali made a fist with his hand and jabbed it in the air. “Like stabbing someone in the back.” 

After his conversion, the fear of rejection flooded his mind. In the underground Tunisian Christian community, there are many stories of converts being exiled from families after being exposed. It took him three months before mustering the courage to tell his family. 

Dali’s family, like any other Tunisian family, was shocked at first. But they did not force him out of his home. He is one of the more fortunate ones from among his group of Christian friends, he said. 

Religion in Tunisia, as in many parts of the Arab world, is cultural and tied heavily to identity. The families of converts consider conversion as a rejection of their roots and identity.

“You’re kind of saying ‘I don’t like my name. I don’t like what you gave me. I don’t like what this family is about, and what you believe in is silly,’” said Dali. 

But that wasn’t the case for Dali. He describes his journey into Christianity as a search for freedom.

“It’s trying to look for something better, trying to look for freedom, for spiritual freedom.” 

## Tunisia, The Arab Spring, and freedom of religion

Tunisia is rated as “free” under the 2015 Freedom House ratings. It ranks as number two after Israel in the region, making it the first Arab country to receive this “free” rating. Almost all of North Africa and the Middle East are labeled “not free” by Freedom House, an independent watchdog organization that analyzes the status of freedom and democracy around the world; otherwise, only Morocco, Lebanon and Kuwait are the only three labeled “partly free” in the region.

Tunisia was the spark of the Arab Spring. The self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi, a fruit vendor protesting against government corruption, caused havoc across the country for a call to bring down the 23-year reign of its long-standing leader Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. Tunisia’s Jasmine Revolution spewed into mass protests across the country as Tunisians called for an end to poverty, corruption and political repression. From Tunisia, the Arab Spring revolutions spread across North Africa and the Middle East. 

That’s why Tunisia was the west’s great hope for the emergence of liberal, democratic societies in the region. Tunisia was the darling of the Arab Spring; many governments and institutions around the world have called it the success story, a model nation.  

Today in Tunisia, there is freedom of religion on paper. One is, by law, able to choose one’s own religion and practice it, just as long as it doesn’t disturb civil society. This provision is in the constitution as it was revised in the wake of the Arab Spring. It promises freedom of religion to those who, during the Ben Ali regime, were prevented from expressing religious identity in public. These included many Muslims: Islamic religious attire such as headscarves (_hijab_) and full-body coverings (_niqab_) were banned under Ben Ali who wanted a more visibly western society.

This change may have seemed like it would benefit the Tunisian Christian minority.

But looks were deceiving.

The Tunisian society’s deeply rooted cultural attitudes and behaviours are much harder to change than laws and constitutions. 

Today, when walking down Tunis’ main street Avenue Habib Bourguiba, you can see a rainbow montage of headscarves. Riding the public metro trains, there are increasing numbers of women in _niqabs_ and men with long beards, dressed in the all white attire of the fundamentalist Sunni Muslim salafi sect. 

Expression of Islam is flourishing in Tunisia. 

This law of religious freedom clearly benefits the majority Muslim population as well as the small, recognized, indigenous Jewish community who have been living on a small Island off the coast of Tunisia for centuries. 

Meanwhile a new and growing Tunisian Christian community is forced in to a difficult choice: remain hidden and be ignored, or be visible and become the target of hostility. 

Interviews with Tunisian Christians show that while persecution is not as overt as in countries like Saudi Arabia and Iran where it is illegal and punishable by law to convert out of Islam, Tunisian Christians face discrimination and targeting that is often obscure and hidden to the public eye. 

It affects their day-to-day lives. Because of their Christian identities, many experience job insecurity, abandonment from family, friends and even fiancés; they are victims of verbal, mental and physical abuse, and are not given equal opportunities under the law to identify themselves as Christians and marry whoever they want. 

That’s why many Tunisian Christians remain underground today. 

Both choices, either to remain hidden or to expose their identities, will lead to hardships and forms of persecution in this predominantly Muslim society. 

The question arises, who is accountable for the marginalization of minorities who are hiding – the society, government or the minorities themselves?

## The question of democracy 

Tunisia is considered a success case for democracy in the Arab World. 
Many governments, media outlets, and institutions have applauded its post-revolution efforts that resulted in a short-lived disorder. Since the end of its revolution dubbed the Jasmine Revolution in 2011, it has had two relatively successful presidential elections, unlike the tumultuous course of its neighbours in the region. It has avoided civil war, and although civilian protests are still common throughout the country, Tunisia does not see the same amount of violent uprisings as its regional counterparts. 

In December 2015, Tunisia’s National Dialogue Quartet, which consists of four civil-society organizations, received a Nobel Peace Prize for promoting political negotiations and democracy. The Nobel committee said the group had made a “decisive contribution to the building of a pluralistic democracy in Tunisia in the wake of the Jasmine Revolution.” The committee said that the Quartet enabled Tunisia to “establish a constitutional system of government guaranteeing fundamental rights for the entire population, irrespective of gender, political conviction or religious belief.” 

These institutions and decades of secular policies implemented by its previous two dictators may have primed the country for a less violent revolution and an easier democratic transition than other Arab lands.

However, Tunisia’s democratic transition is influenced by the region’s deeply religious realities, engrained in its politics, culture and the daily lives of its people. There is one predominant religion in this region – Islam – and when secularism and democracy clashes with Tunisia’s long-standing religious customs, the result may not be “democratic” as many in the west understand it.  

Five years after the revolution, there is a group of people within this “model democratic society” who are still living under great social pressure to hide their identities. They are a religious minority who are treated like second-class citizens if they reveal their religious beliefs. Their rights are not protected. 

As this unique movement towards democracy progresses in the heart of the Arab Spring, it is questionable as to who really flourishes from it. 

Is a democracy that benefits a particular group of people while neglecting another acceptable for this region of the world? How important are religious rights and freedom in the movement towards a successful democracy? 

And being aware of the harsh consequences, what motivates certain people to willingly commit the bold, rebellious act of leaving Islam in a 99 per cent Muslim society? 

## The Tunisian Christian population

The Christian phenomenon in Tunisia is relatively new, seemingly emerging since the revolution according to Christian religious leaders working in Tunisia. Specifically, many Tunisian youth, in their teens to late twenties, are turning to Christianity since the revolution. 

But the Tunisian Christian community remains microscopic. 

“We are a minority of minorities,” said Dali. 

The American government’s International Religious Freedom Report for 2011 states that Tunisia is 99 per cent Sunni Muslim; the remaining 1 per cent of population includes Shia Muslims, Jews, Bahais, and Christians. The report claims that Christianity is the second largest religion in Tunisia. However, most of these Christians are expatriates working or living in Tunisia. They come from all over the world, from France to Lebanon. The size of the indigenous Arab-Tunisian Christian population is hard to pinpoint mainly because many remain underground. Evangelical Christian research organizations, such as [Joshua Project](http://google.com) which have the most access to the underground religious communities, estimate that just over 0.2 per cent of the Arab Tunisians are professing Christians.

Due to their small numbers, Tunisian Christians living in Tunisia go unnoticed, sometimes even to one another. That’s why their persecution seems almost nonexistent, according to Dali. 

“Persecution is quasi-absent. We’re almost invisible.” 

Dali’s labeling of the Tunisian Christians’ ‘quasi-absent’ existence is rooted in numbers. There’s an estimated 22,000 Tunisian Christians living among the 11 million Muslims. Statistically speaking, there are more extremist Muslims being persecuted in Tunisia than Christians. “Women, older people, lower class people in society are more persecuted than us,” said Dali. 

“So why should anyone care about us?” he asked, as if he hadn’t entertained this thought before. This majority-centric mentality is a dominant worldview engrained in the society he lives in today.

[image](content/01_Dali/Dali_IMG6.jpg "\"Tunisia just screams it loud. If they reject you, they will just say it to your face - I reject you and this is why: because you are not like us.\"")

Dali said he struggles with feeling censored.

Expression is at the core of his artistry. But there’s a huge disconnect between his passions as an artist and his identity as a Christian. 

“I’m living 1,000 per cent of the time of every millisecond through dancing and photography,” he smiled. “Expressing myself as a dancer, and as a photographer through other people’s shots and movements of the body – I feel free.” 

But on the other hand, Dali struggles with expressing his identity as a Christian. 

“I want to express myself. I want to say what I really am, but I can’t,” he said. 
“Because I want people to accept me.” 

Ever since his conversion, he said he is constantly worried about other people’s reactions. Dali has had several encounters with co-workers, friends, and even strangers who verbally abused him or cut contact with him after finding out he was Christian. Members of the breakdance community sometimes target him on social media, if they suspect he’s Christian from the posts he likes and shares.  There are comments on his wall and photos insulting him and even his mother. “I’ve heard the f-word many times,” he said. 

“It hurts how people find one thing that is different about you and they show all the hate of the world to you,” he said. Many times, these hurtful words and comments stayed with him for the rest of the month, “and maybe for the rest of my life,” he said.  

But to him, this is far from victimization. In fact, Dali, like many other Tunisian Christians, refused to call it persecution. 

Firstly, it’s because many of his Christian brothers and sisters face far more harsh conditions in places like Saudi Arabia and Iran, he said. Secondly, he said that allowing oneself to be victimized is burdening oneself. 

“Why should I call it persecution?” he asked. “With that mindset, I will be easily depressed and maybe not be able to stand up on my feet again.”

But this is the choice he made. And in that choice, he found his freedom. 

“To be free is to make a choice, and anybody getting in the way of that choice is taking away the freedom of his will from him,” he said.

In his uncommon, radical decision to leave Islam and enter Christianity, Dali said he found what he was looking for in his search for his true identity. 

“I found myself. I’m free being myself. I accepted myself.”

Dali jutted out his right hand in a stop-motion. He looked up at the café speakers and started shrugging his shoulders up-and-down, pulsing his hands through the stinging, smoke-filled air. 

“Uptown Funk,” he smirked. “It’s my favourite song.” Dali bopped to the jazzy, electro-funk until the song was over. 

“Hey, at least it’s got hallelujah in it,” he winked.
