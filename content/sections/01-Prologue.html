<p>It’s a large, airy room. It’s dark.</p>

<p>There are three bodies inside. Two of them are jerking to a rhythm, sweat drops dripping down the side of their clenched jaws, strained necks, and flexed arms. </p>

<p>Their loose, street-style clothes are drunk with perspiration. With every twitch and turn, sweat splatters across the black, wooden stage. The floodlight is crimson, a reflection of the hundreds of fold-up seats and theatrical curtains that drape along the stage.</p>

<p>A meter away, swallowed in the thick air of the theatre, the other body crouches low. </p>

<p>His eyes are the only moving part of his body. They are filled with concentration and admiration.  </p>

<p>Snap. </p>

<p>He carefully shifts his olive-green sneakers and turns the lens of his Canon Digital SLR. </p>

<p>They’re inside Cinéma le Mondial (Universal Movie Theatre)– a theatre tucked away in a side street at the heart of Tunis. It’s a hot-spot for many up and coming dancers of Tunis. Today, the photographer is shooting the national breakdancing champions of Morocco and Algeria – B-boy Wolf and B-boy Amarou were prepping for their next competition. It was a freelancing gig he landed through his cousin.  </p>

<p>It was tough landing freelance work these days. Well, always, says the photographer. He often found himself scrambling to pay his rent living in the capital for the past seven years. When he ran out of money, he’d have to drag his feet back home to small-town Jendouba where his family lived. He would work in a call-center or find other work until he made just enough to come back to the capital for what he loved: He breathed breakdancing. He lived photography. </p>

<p>So did the two spinning and shuffling before him. But he was different from them. And it wasn’t his gangly, tall frame compared to their shorter, boyish frames that easily rode the airwaves. It wasn’t physical. It was internal. Spiritual, even. </p>

<p>Many like the photographer were stoned, stabbed, beat, and arrested in Tunisia. </p>

<p>But his story was different. For him, he was muzzled. Censored, he calls it. </p>

<p>The music stops. The black speakers on the edge of the stage are mute and there is just a low airy hum of emptiness in the dark theatre.</p>

<p>As he packs up his gear, the two dancers dry themselves up. The three begin to converse for what it seems like the first time. Small talk.</p>

<p>“What are you up to this weekend?” </p>

<p>The photographer hesitates. It’s a strange digression from his bright personality. He’s talkative, goofy and has a sarcastic sense of humour that draws out snickers. But today, his shoulders tense up and he holds his breath.</p>

<p>Keneesa, he answers. Church, in Arabic. </p>

<p>The two b-boys pause and stare. “Shnouwa?” What?</p>

<p>The photographer explains. </p>

<p>Wolf shakes his head. &quot;La, la, la.&quot; No, no, no, he says in Arabic. </p>

<p>“Mafhemteksh,” says the Algerian. I don’t get you. </p>

<p>And that’s how the conversation ends. It’s all too familiar for the photographer: he’s unnatural; he’s mocked; he’s misunderstood. </p>

<p>He’s a stranger in his own nation. </p>

<p>Dali Khlifi, 27, sits at a café bobbing his head to the music. He takes an occasional sip of qahwah, a viscous, bitter Arabic espresso with Turkish roots which requires an acquired taste. </p>

<p>Dali is a freelance photographer and a lover of breakdance. </p>

<p>He’s also a Tunisian Christian, living among the estimated 99 per cent Muslim population.  </p>

<p>Dali left Islam over three years ago. A close friend living in his dormitory had shared about Christianity to him. This was the first time Dali had heard about Jesus the Son of God, not Jesus the prophet in Islam. </p>

<p>“I had to think about my roots, my society,” Dali recalled the days leading up to his conversion. </p>

<p>“I felt like I was cheating on them [his society],” Dali made a fist with his hand and jabbed it in the air. “Like stabbing someone in the back.” </p>

<p>After his conversion, the fear of rejection flooded his mind. In the underground Tunisian Christian community, there are many stories of converts being exiled from families after being exposed. It took him three months before mustering the courage to tell his family. </p>

<p>Dali’s family, like any other Tunisian family, was shocked at first. But they did not force him out of his home. He was one of the more fortunate ones from among his group of Christian friends, he says. </p>

<p>Religion in Tunisia, like in many parts of the Arab world, is cultural and tied heavily to identity. The families consider it a rejection of one’s identity and roots when changing one’s religion from Islam to Christianity.</p>

<p>“You’re kind of saying ‘I don’t like my name. I don’t like what you gave me. I don’t like what this family is about, and what you believe in is silly,’” said Dali. </p>

<p>But that wasn’t the case for Dali. He describes his journey into Christianity as a search for freedom.</p>

<p>“It’s trying to look for something better, trying to look for freedom, for spiritual freedom.” </p>

				Tunisia, The Arab Spring, and Freedom of Religion
			</div>
		</div>
<p>The 2015 Freedom House ratings deem Tunisia’s status as free. Tunisia’s freedom rating is 2.0 on a scale of one to seven, with one as best and seven as worst. It ranks as number two after Israel, which has a rating of 1.5. Tunisia is an idiosyncrasy where almost all of North Africa and the Middle East is predominantly labeled “not free” by the Freedom House; Morrocco, Lebanon and Kuwait are the only three labeled “partly free.” </p>

<p>Tunisia was the spark of the Arab Spring, with the self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi causing a rapid fire to break across the country for a call to bring down the 23-year reign of their long-standing leader Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. It was first from Tunisia that cries of freedom rang across North Africa and the Middle East. </p>

<p>That’s why Tunisia was the West’s hope for liberal, democratic societies in this region of the world. It was the darling of the Arab Spring; many have called it the success case, a model nation.  </p>

<p>Today in Tunisia, there is freedom of religion. One is, by law, able to choose one’s own religion and practice it, just as long as it doesn’t disturb civil society. This is in the revised constitution of 2014. This revised constitution promised freedom of religion to those who, under the Ben Ali regime, were oppressed from expressing religious identity in public. (Religious attire for Muslims, such as the headscarves (Hijjab) and full-body coverings (Niqab), were banned under Ben Ali. He desired a more visibly western society).</p>

<p>This revision may seem favorable for the Christian religious minority living in Tunisia. </p>

<p>But it’s a deceiving shell. </p>

<p>The Tunisian society’s deeply rooted cultural attitudes and behaviours are much harder to change than laws and constitutions. This law of religious freedom serves to benefit the majority Muslim population as well as the small, acknowledged, indigenous Jewish community, estimated at roughly 2,000 people by Justice for Jews for Arab Countries, a non-profit advocacy group. </p>

<p>Today, when walking down the center of Tunis, Avenue Habib Bourguiba is a rainbow montage of headscarves. Riding the public metro trains, there are increasing numbers of women in niqabs and men with long beards, dressed in all white Salafi (fundamental Sunni Islamist) attire. </p>

<p>Expression of Islam is flourishing in Tunisia. </p>

<p>Meanwhile the growing Tunisian Christian community is forced in to a difficult choice: remain hidden and be ignored, or be visible and receive hostility. </p>

<p>Both of these choices lead to inevitable hardships and forms of persecution in this predominantly Muslim society. </p>

				The Tunisian Christian Population
			</div>
		</div>
<p>The modern-day Christian phenomenon in Tunisia is relatively new, seemingly emerging since the revolution according to Christian religious leaders working in Tunisia. </p>

<p>But still, the Tunisian Christian community in Tunisia is microscopic. </p>

<p>“We are a minority of minorities,” says Dali. </p>

<p>The United States International Religious Freedom Report for 2011 states that Tunisia is 99 per cent Sunni Muslim; the remaining 1 per cent of population includes Shia Muslims, Jews, Bahas, and Christians. The report claims that Christianity is the second largest religion in Tunisia. However, the majority of the Christians are expatriates working or living in Tunisia. They come from all over the world, from neighboring Italy to Lebanon. The Arab-Tunisian Christian population, however, is a number that is hard to pinpoint mainly because many remain underground. Evangelical Christian organizations, such as the Joshua Project (global research initiative) who have the most access to the underground religious communities, estimate just under 0.3 per cent for the Arab-Tunisian Christian population. </p>

<p>Due to this very small percentage of Tunisian Christians living in Tunisia, they go unnoticed, even amongst one another. That’s why their persecution is almost inexistent, according to Dali. </p>

<p>“Persecution is quasi-absent. We’re almost invisible.” </p>

<p>Statistically, there are more extremist Muslims being persecuted in Tunisia than Christians. Looking at mere numbers, “women, older people, lower class people in society are more persecuted than us,” says Dali.  </p>

<p>“So why should anyone care about us?” He asks in awe. </p>

<p>Dali says he struggles with feeling censored.</p>

<p>Expression is at the core of his artistry. But there’s a huge disconnect between his passions as an artist and his identity as a Christian. </p>

<p>“I’m living 1,000 per cent of the time of every millisecond through dancing and photography,” he smiles. “Expressing myself as a dancer, and as a photographer through other people’s shots and movements of the body – I feel free.” </p>

<p>But on the other hand, Dali struggles with expressing his true identity as a Christian. </p>

<p>“I want to express myself. I want to say what I really am, but I can’t,” he says. </p>

<p>“Because I want people to accept me.” </p>

<p>Ever since his conversion, he says he is constantly worried about other people’s reactions. Dali has had several encounters with co-workers, friends, and even strangers who verbally abused him or cut contact with him after finding out he was Christian. Members of the breakdance community sometimes target him on social media, if they suspect he’s Christian from the posts he likes and shares.  There are comments on his wall and photos insulting him and even his mother. “I’ve heard the f-word many times,” he says. (*<em>insert crude facebook comment here *</em>) </p>

<p>“It hurts how people find one thing that is different about you and they show all the hate of the world to you,” he says. Many times, these hurtful words and comments stay with him for the rest of the month, “and maybe the rest of my life.”  </p>

<p>But to him, this is far from victimization. In fact, Dali refuses to call it persecution. </p>

<p>Firstly, it’s because many of his Christian brothers and sisters face far more harsh conditions in places like Saudi Arabia and Iran, he says. Secondly, he says that victimizing oneself is burdening oneself. </p>

<p><em>“Why should I call it persecution?”</em> he asks. <em>“With that mindset, I will be easily depressed and maybe not be able to stand up on my feet again.”</em></p>

				“I want to say it loudly. Don’t consider everything persecution, even if it’s true. Even if they kick you out of work, even if they punch you, even if you starve to death because you don’t have<br/><br/> family or place to crash, even if you sleep in the garden, even if someone beats you to death. Because if you accept everything as persecution, between you and yourself, how the heck are you tomorrow morning look to yourself and say I still have a better day, I still have hope for myself?”

<p>But this is the choice he made. And in that choice, he found his freedom. In his matrix-like society, he found the red pill, says Dali. </p>

<p>“To be free is to make a choice, and anybody getting in the way of that choice is taking away the freedom of his will from him.” </p>

<hr/>

<p>Dali juts out his right hand in a stop-motion. He looks up at the café speakers and starts shrugging his shoulders up-and-down, pulsing his hands through the stinging, smoke-filled air. </p>

<p>“Uptown Funk,” he smirks. “It’s my favourite song.” Dali bops to the jazzy, electro-funk until the song is over. </p>

<p>“Hey, at least it’s got hallelujah in it,” he winks. </p>
