_God, where are you?_

Silence. 

_God, if you are here, tell me something. I know you can do it, you created me. You created the world._

Silence.

_God, I’m tired of this life. I’m tired of searching._  

Silence.

_God, where are you?_

Silence. 

_God, I need you._

Silence.

His heart was cold. Stone cold. He got up from his knees, dusted his clothes and rolled up his prayer mat.

He walked out of the mosque for the last time in his life.

> "But in Tunisia, you can do it. You can confess. And then you will face some problems. But after you will live your life like any other people." - Marwan

Marwan Ben-Said is 26 years old. 

He’s a cinematographer. He’s also a full-time Christian worker as the founding leader of Youth North Africa, a Christian missionary organization.

Marwan was 17 years old when he decided to become a Christian. 

It had been a long journey for him as a teen, contemplating, reading and asking about Islam. Since the age of 12, he had asked his grandfather endless questions about Islam. His grandfather was an imam at one of the biggest and oldest mosques in Tunis. Many times, he said his grandfather answered with “I don’t know” or with silence to his questions. 

This became the stepping-stone of his search for answers.

“Do not be afraid, I am with you,” was the audible voice of God that he said he heard one day while searching for answers at a Catholic church.

“From that moment, I decided to follow Jesus,” he said. 

It was through this decision that he was able to find peace in his heart. He was able to forgive those who had wronged him in the past, he said. For him, it was one particular individual, an older man who had sexually abused him as a child. 

“I felt that if I could find him now that I’m grown up, I would kill him,” he said, recalling how he felt before his conversion. “But when I believed in Jesus, he gave me healing for this. He touched my heart and said ‘forgive.’”

Marwan went to his family and told them about his new faith and his decision to forgive this man. 

He recalled that his mother began to cry and his family was fearful. They were in awe that he was able to forgive this man, but they were upset over his conversion. 

People in his community began to talk. “My family started to hear people say ‘Shame! Shame! He left Islam! Shame on you. How did your son leave Islam!’” 

Marwan chuckled, “The shame…” 

But he said that it’s not the conversion into Christianity that Tunisians care about; rather, it’s the shame culture that pushes many to react this way. Many cultures influenced by Islam generally hold a higher standard of honor and shame in the household. There are many things that can bring shame and degrade the honor of oneself or a household name. 

“But the bigger shame is when someone kills the other person. The shame is when someone lies. The shame is when someone doesn’t accept another. The shame is when someone doesn’t honour his people in his country, and say just get out of this country,” said Marwan.

Coming out of hiding will be hard, he said, but there is a greater consequence for those who do not confess their faith to others. “They will live a lie. They will not live in truth. They will not have peace of mind.”

“But in Tunisia, you can do it. You can confess. And then you will face some problems, but after you will live your life like any other person.”

## The new church 

The church of Tunisia is new. 

Most Tunisian Christians known today are first-generation converts who left Islam. 

This is why it is so shocking for the Muslims when they are faced with this idiosyncrasy. It’s not common and they have never wrestled with such a phenomenon in their country in recent history. 

Tunisian society is unique in the Arab world. By democratic standards, it is far more progressive than its Arab counterparts. 

For decades since its independence in 1956, Tunisian presidents have pushed for a more modern, secular and tolerant society. This attitude is reflected in its reformed laws and constitutions since the revolution. 

But like any society, when faced with new challenges, it reacts. 

That is the case for the 99 per cent Muslim in Tunisia today. 

With such a handful of Tunisian Christians exposing their identities, the 99 per cent have yet to understand and hear their stories. 

Although there is a responsibility for the Tunisian government and society to respond to this dent in their democracy, the onus is also on the estimated 0.2 per cent of Tunisian Christians. 

They face two decisions: to remain hiding and be ignored, or to emerge from underground and be heard. 

Both choices will receive reactions, some harsher than others. 

“But society will never change,” said Marwan, unless the Christians take a hold of their rights. 

“We need to take it. We need to ask. We need to knock the doors. We need to go. We need to find another solution,” he said. 

“And if you don’t want to be persecuted eventually, you need to live in this society as a Christian today,” said Marwan. 

“As light in the darkness. As salt of the earth.”
